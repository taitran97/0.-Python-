# y = 3
# print(x + y)

# 2. Assignment Operators

# x = x + 3
# x = 3
# x += 3
# print(x)

# 3. Comparison Operators

# x = 3
# y = 3
# print(x == y)

# 4. Logical Operators

# True if both statements are true.
# x = True
# y = True
# print(x and y)

# 5. Identity Operators

# True if both variables are the same object.
# x = ("Alexander", "Maldini", "Nesta")
# y = ("Alexander", "Maldini", "Nesta")
# print(x is y)

# 6. Membership Operators
